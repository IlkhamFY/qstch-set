In this contribution, a new design framework leveraging Bayesian optimisation is developed to
enhance the efficiency and quality of material and structural design processes. The proposed
framework comprises two main steps. The first step involves efficiently exploring the design
space with a minimum number of sampled points to mitigate computational costs. In the
subsequent step, a composite Bayesian optimisation strategy is employed to evaluate the
objective function and identify the next candidate for sampling. By building a surrogate
model for numerical simulation responses in a fixed-size latent response space and using
techniques like Principal Component Analysis for dimensionality reduction, the framework
effectively exploits the composition aspect of the objective function. Unlike traditional methods
that rely on random sampling across the design space, our Bayesian optimisation approach
uses a dynamic, adaptive sampling strategy. This method significantly reduces the number
of required experiments while effectively managing uncertainty. We evaluate the framework’s
performance across various design scenarios and conduct a critical comparative analysis against
well-established data-driven approaches. These scenarios include linear and nonlinear material
and structural behaviours, addressing multi-objective optimisation and data variability. Our
findings demonstrate substantial improvements in performance and quality, particularly in
nonlinear settings. This underscores the framework’s potential to advance design methodologies
in material and structural engineering.
1. Introduction
The rapid advancement of innovative numerical methods and cutting-edge technologies has revolutionised the development
of advanced materials and structures tailored for specific applications. In material design, the primary objective is to carefully
select the chemical structure, composition, or processing conditions to meet precise design criteria [1]. Typical design requirements
include maximising the material’s toughness and strength while minimising cost and weight, Although the allure of optimising
material and structural design is undeniable, it remains a highly iterative and time-intensive process, The advent of machine
learning techniques, increased computational power, and more accurate modelling tools have made simulation-based data-driven
design frameworks a powerful alternative for material and structural design, Compared to physical experiments, the reduced costs
associated with numerical simulations have further motivated the development of these frameworks, In the numerical community,

these challenges are often referred to as inverse problems, where the goal is to identify the input parameters that yield a desired
output response by solving an optimisation problem, Solving this problem is still challenging, especially when dealing with high-
dimensional design spaces and costly numerical simulations, Efficiently selecting candidates for evaluation is crucial to reducing the
cost of the optimisation process, making sample efficiency a key priority for exploring the design space.
Solving inverse problems is a cross-disciplinary challenge that has received considerable attention in the literature. In mechanical
engineering, notable works include Tanaka and Bui [2], Martins et al. [3], Juang and Sun [4]. Other applications are found in
physiology [5], ecology [6] and sedimentation analysis [7]. Inverse problems can be classified into gradient-based or gradient-free
optimisation depending on the objective function to optimise. Gradient-based methods are preferred for high-dimensional spaces,
but when it is impossible to compute or approximate the derivatives of the objective function, gradient-free methods become the
only viable option. This work focuses on problems where the objective function is expensive to evaluate, gradients are unavailable,
and observations may be noisy — commonly referred to as black-box optimisation problems.
In material modelling, a typical application of inverse problems is identifying material parameters from experimental data,
as demonstrated by Pal et al. [8],Pichler et al. [9], Rokonuzzaman and Sakai [10], Andrade-Campos et al. [11], Colak and
Cakir [12], Sedighiani et al. [13], Savage et al. [14], Cardoso Coelho et al. [15]. Various optimisation algorithms have been
employed to solve these problems, including Nelder–Mead [16,17], genetic [8–14] and evolutionary algorithms [18,19], Bayesian
optimisation [20] and the recently proposed LIPO [21] algorithm [22,23]. Additionally, the rising interest in machine learning has
driven the development of new methods for optimising hyperparameters, such as learning rates and the number of neurons and
layers in neural networks. This context further underscores the need for sample-efficient methods for solving inverse problems with
expensive objective functions.
From a mathematical standpoint, optimisation can be solved using various methods that only require observations of the objective
function, but evaluating the objective value remains a complex task. Numerical tools used for solving the physical response of systems
necessitate multiple steps for each function call: setting up the numerical model, solving governing equations, extracting desired
responses, and computing the objective value. Similarly, experimentally-driven optimisations require conducting an experiment
for each function call. Several strategies have been proposed to address these challenges to streamline the optimisation process
and leverage the problem structure. Some strategies have been proposed to alleviate the burden of the optimisation process and
to exploit this problem structure. For instance, Bessa and colleagues [24] introduced a computational framework for material
and structural design, comprising three main steps: (i) exploring the design space using Design of Experiments (DoE) methods,
(ii) efficiently simulating each design sample computationally, and (iii) constructing a surrogate model using machine learning
techniques. In material design contexts, this approach approximates the optimisation of the original objective function through
optimisation of a less costly surrogate model. This surrogate model, as demonstrated Bessa and Pellegrino [25], also facilitates
the introduction of uncertainty quantification and multi-objective optimisation into the design process. Naturally, constructing this
low-fidelity surrogate model involves creating a dataset and subsequently training a machine learning model. Examples of predictive
models trained on computational data can be found in recent studies [26–29]. Additionally, Bessa et al. [24] advocate for using
reduced-order models to accelerate further dataset evaluation, such as the self-consistent clustering analysis (SCA) [30].
Inspired by the work in Bessa et al. [24], numerous authors have advanced techniques for solving optimisation problems
using machine learning. Abueidda et al. [31] and [32] proposed an optimisation framework based on neural networks optimised
with a Genetic algorithm. Abueidda et al. [31] employed this framework to identify optimal microstructural descriptors of a
two-dimensional checkerboard composite, while [32] used it to optimise the post-buckling of composite stiffened panels under
compression loads. Sridhara et al. [1], applied a neural network model with automatic differentiation for gradient-based optimisation
in microstructural design. Huang et al. [33] introduced a six-step mechanistic data science framework for materials design,
encompassing (i) multimodal data generation and collection, (ii) mechanistic feature extraction, (iii) knowledge-driven dimension
reduction, (iv) reduced-order modelling, (v) mechanistic learning through regression and classification, and (vi) system and design.
The dimension reduction in step (iii) is achieved using principal component analysis (PCA). This framework successfully predicted
composite material systems for targeted properties using a knowledge database.
Despite the excellent results achieved in these studies, Zhang et al. [34] argued that optimising surrogate models is inefficient
if the design objective is well-defined. Their approach avoids choosing sampling points close to optimal locations, instead selecting
random points across the entire design space. In contrast, Bayesian Optimisation (BO) provides a more efficient, adaptive sampling
paradigm [35]. Wang and Dowling [36] demonstrated that a Bayesian Optimisation-driven inverse design framework requires
significantly fewer experiments compared to the traditional Edisonian approach.
Bayesian optimisation is one of the most popular methods for solving expensive black-box optimisation problems, and has
seen numerous applications over the last years [37–42]. It is widely recognised for its sample efficiency in exploring the design
space to optimising the objective function. The core idea behind this method is constructing a probabilistic surrogate model for
the objective function, which guides the search for the optimal solution by solving cheaper inner optimisation problems. For
instance, Cardoso Coelho et al. [15] compared several optimisation algorithms for the parameter identification of various constitutive
models, demonstrating that Bayesian optimisation is one of the best options for this task. Additionally, their work proposes a
composite Bayesian optimisation framework that performs orders of magnitude better than standard Bayesian optimisation in some
instances. This strategy builds on the work of Astudillo and Frazier [43], leveraging the compositional nature of the objective
function to improve the quality of the inner surrogate model dramatically. However, this method has been proposed for the curve
fitting problem, and its application to design problems still needs to be explored.
In this work, we extend the composite Bayesian optimisation strategy to address the response design problem, enabling a
more efficient solution for material and structural design challenges. This extension requires generalising the composition proposed

by Cardoso Coelho et al. [15] to optimise arbitrary responses, making our approach a superset of the previous work and allowing
the curve fitting problem to be recovered as a particular case. The composite variant offers several compelling advantages over
standard Bayesian optimisation:
• Comprehensive Response Analysis: The optimiser observes the entire response instead of a single scalar objective value. This
reduces information loss during the computation of the objective function, allowing the optimiser to make more informed
decisions.
• Embedded Reduction Function: The reduction function that computes the scalar objective value from the system’s response is
directly embedded within the optimisation framework. This eliminates the need for the surrogate model to learn the shape of
the reduction function, streamlining the optimisation process.
• Improved Predictive Ability: The composite strategy employs multi-dimensional Gaussian processes, enhancing the predictive
capability of the surrogate model for the objective function.
Additionally, we explore Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as a dimensionality reduction technique to lower the computational
cost of the method and, as a side benefit, enhance optimisation quality. Furthermore, we extend the method to multi-objective
optimisation, which can be seamlessly integrated with the composite setting. To address the hyperparameters that arise from this
formulation, we discuss heuristics to guide their selection. We then present a comparative analysis of our method’s performance
against classical Bayesian optimisation, the data-driven framework developed by [24] for both single- and multi-objective opti-
misation problems, and, as a baseline, simple random search. Several applications are considered in this comparison, including
the optimisation of an analytical response, the maximisation of the toughness of a particle-reinforced composite, the design of a
compression–torsion coupling metamaterial under both single- and multi-objective optimisation, and the cross-section design of a
metallic foam beam under bending. These examples demonstrate the broad applicability of the proposed method and its potential
to solve complex design problems more efficiently than state-of-the-art methods.
This paper is organised to provide a comprehensive overview and detailed analysis of the proposed method. In Section 2, we begin
by outlining the optimisation problem and thoroughly detailing the formulation of the composite Bayesian optimisation strategy,
addressing both single- and multi-objective scenarios. Section 3 delves into practical heuristics for selecting the hyperparameters of
the method, offering guidance on how to fine-tune the approach effectively. Section 4 provides an in-depth comparative analysis,
evaluating the performance of the proposed method against current state-of-the-art approaches across a range of design problems,
highlighting its advantages and areas of improvement. Finally, Section 5 summarises the key findings of the study, presents
conclusions drawn from the analysis, and discusses potential avenues for future research to enhance further and apply the proposed
method.
2. A data-driven approach to the inverse problem
Material and structural design problems require finding a system’s optimal geometry, chemical composition, or other relevant
physical attributes to achieve a desired performance. In this context, one must parametrise the system into a set of input design
variables in a given domain or parameter space. Examples of design variables span material phase volume fractions, material
properties, manufacturing parameters, and geometric features. The response of the system is strongly dependent on this set of
parameters. Finding the optimal solution requires searching the design space to maximise or minimise a given objective function.
In the most general case, computing the objective function requires the evaluation of the system for a given set of input design
variables — the system’s response can only be observed via sampling and no additional information is available.
Numerous ways can be employed to evaluate the system’s response. These comprise analytical models, numerical simulations,
and experimental tests. While analytical models are generally more informative,1 they are often limited to simple geometries and
material models. On the other hand, experimental tests are a high-fidelity representation of the system’s response, but they are often
expensive, noisy and time-consuming. Within this context, numerical simulations are a popular choice for evaluating the system’s
response, allowing it to solve the problem at an arbitrary level of complexity. With the advent of high-performance computing,
these tools have become increasingly popular in the field of material and structural design, enabling the application of data-driven
approaches to the inverse problem.
Since this is a highly iterative process, automated unsupervised optimisation techniques are required to explore the design space
efficiently. To this end, we explore a novel composite Bayesian optimisation framework for the structural and material design
inverse problem. This strategy has been implemented in the piglot package, an in-house open-source Python package for the
derivative-free optimisation of numerical responses [44]. As depicted in Fig. 1, the package connects the numerical solver with the
optimisation algorithm, providing a seamless interface for the design problem.
In this section, we explore the theoretical foundations of the data-driven approach to the inverse problem. Firstly, the inverse
problem is posed in Section 2.1, where the objective function is defined as a black-box function that depends on the output of a
numerical simulation. Then, the classical Bayesian optimisation framework is described in Section 2.2. Subsequently, the composite
Bayesian optimisation framework is introduced in Section 2.3. Finally, the multi-objective problem is presented in Section 2.4, along
with its solution using Bayesian optimisation.
1 For instance, derivatives can be extracted to accelerate optimisation routines.

to maximise the toughness of the structure.
2.1. Inverse problem
Within the setting of this work, the inverse problem is mathematically defined as follows: given a set of input parameters 𝜽in
the parameter space , the goal is to find the optimal set of parameters 𝜽∗that maximises a given objective function 𝐽(𝜽),
𝜽∗= ar g max
𝜽∈𝐽(𝜽).
(1)
The objective function 𝐽(𝜽) is a deterministic scalar-valued function evaluated through the solution of a physical model or a
numerical simulation. Without loss of generality, this function is assumed to be determined from a reduction operation (𝜽, ∙)
applied to the output of a numerical simulation [𝜽], that is,
𝐽(𝜽) = (𝜽, [𝜽]) .
(2)
The reduction operation (∙) is responsible for computing a scalar value for the quantity of interest from the output of the numerical
simulation. On the other hand, the functional [𝜽] represents the numerical simulation that solves the physical model for a given
set of input parameters 𝜽. In practice, the output quantities are generally discrete and time-dependent for numerical simulations.
Thus, a discrete-time grid 𝒕(𝜽) and the output of the numerical simulation 𝒀(𝜽) can be obtained from the simulation functional, that
is,
[𝜽] ⇒𝒕(𝜽), 𝒀(𝜽).
(3)
The time is a vector-valued quantity and, for completeness, is assumed to be dependent on the input parameters.2 In contrast, the
matrix-valued term 𝒀(𝜽) can represent any output of the numerical simulation, including both scalar quantities such as forces or
pointwise stresses, but also full-field measurements such as displacement or stress fields. This allows recasting the objective function
into the discretised variant,
𝐽(𝜽) = (𝜽, 𝒕(𝜽), 𝒀(𝜽)) .
(4)
With this expression, the compositional nature of the objective function is explicitly stated, where the reduction function is applied
to the time grid 𝒕(𝜽) and the output of the numerical simulation 𝒀(𝜽). This aspect is crucial for the proposed methodology, and is
further explored in Section 2.3.
It is assumed that the fields 𝑡(𝜽) and 𝒀(𝜽) are expensive to evaluate, and that their gradients are not available. Therefore, the
objective function 𝐽(𝜽) is treated as a black-box from which we can only extract information via sampling on the parameter space.
This assumption places strong constraints on the optimisation procedure: gradient-based methods are not feasible and, to reduce
the computational cost, the number of evaluations of the objective function must be minimised.
As a final note, we limit the scope of the work to the optimisation of the time-dependent responses. By adopting a reparameter-
isation of the time axis, we can directly optimise quantities computed from force–displacement or stress–strain curves, which are
common in the field of material design. By considering the decomposition of the objective function into and , this approach can
be easily generalisable for optimising any quantity computable from the numerical response.
2.2. Bayesian optimisation
Bayesian optimisation is a widely recognised technique for optimising costly-to-evaluate black-box functions with unknown
derivatives [45]. The fundamental principle involves constructing a surrogate model based on a dataset of known function
2 In the most common cases, the time is independent of the parameters. This dependency is introduced for the completeness of the formulation.

evaluations. Subsequently, a collection of utility functions is utilised to identify the next candidate(s) sampling point(s). The basic
structure of a Bayesian optimisation loop is outlined in Algorithm 1. In this work, we use the BoTorch package [46] to implement
the Bayesian optimisation algorithm.

A schematic representation of the Bayesian optimisation framework for the design problem is depicted in Fig. 2. The first step
is the problem setup, where the design variables, the objective function and the budget of evaluations 𝑛calls are defined for the
numerical problem at hand. Then, an initial Design of Experiments (DoE) is performed to sample the design space, using 𝑛init
points, where the objective function is evaluated at each point. It is assumed that this dataset is only built to start the process and
that the number of DoE points is much smaller than the total budget of evaluations, that is, 𝑛init ≪ 𝑛calls. Finally, the Bayesian
optimisation loop is initiated, where the surrogate model is built from the initial dataset and the acquisition function is optimised
to select the next sampling point. This is repeated until the budget of evaluations is exhausted, at which point the algorithm returns
the best-observed point.
2.2.1. Surrogate model
In the Bayesian optimisation context, the most frequently adopted surrogate model is a Gaussian process (GP) [47]. A GP is a
probabilistic model that defines a distribution over functions, that is,
𝑓∼(𝜇(𝜽), 𝑘(𝜽, 𝜽′)) ,
(5)
where 𝜇(𝜽) and 𝑘(𝜽, 𝜽′) are the prior mean and covariance functions. Without loss of generality, the prior mean is usually set to zero,
and the covariance function is defined by a kernel function 𝑘(𝜽, 𝜽′) that accounts for the correlation between the input parameters,
Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering 434 (2025) 117516 
5 
R.P. Cardoso Coelho et al.
usually through the Euclidean distance between 𝜽and 𝜽′. These quantities constitute the prior of the GP, which is then conditioned
with the observed data to obtain the posterior distribution. After 𝑛observations, the posterior distribution of the GP is given by
𝑓(𝜽) ∼(𝜇𝑛(𝜽), 𝜎2
𝑛(𝜽)) ,
(6)
where the posterior mean 𝜇𝑛(𝜽) and variance 𝜎2
𝑛(𝜽) can be computed by the expressions in Rasmussen and Williams [47, Section
2.2] and Frazier [45, Section 3]. In other words, the value of the function 𝑓at any point 𝜽is assumed as a Gaussian distribution
with mean 𝜇𝑛(𝜽) and variance 𝜎2
𝑛(𝜽).
While the GP is, by construction, a hyperparameter-free model, the definition of the kernel requires estimating a set of
hyperparameters for the covariance function. Consider a Matérn kernel, given by,
𝑘Matern(𝜽, 𝜽′) = 𝛼21−𝜈
𝛤(𝜈)
(√
2𝜈(𝜽−𝜽′)𝑇𝑳−1 (𝜽−𝜽′))𝜈
𝐾𝜈
(√
2𝜈(𝜽−𝜽′)𝑇𝑳−1 (𝜽−𝜽′))
,
(7)
where 𝛤is the gamma function, 𝐾𝜈is the modified Bessel function, and 𝜈is the smoothness parameter. In this work, the latter is
fixed as 𝜈= 2.5. Furthermore, 𝛼is the output scale parameter and 𝑳is a diagonal matrix with the lengthscale hyperparameters,
which must be estimated according to the training data. In addition, the observations may contain a certain level of noise 𝜎𝜖, that
is,
𝑦= 𝑓(𝜽) + 𝜖 ,
with 𝜖∼(0, 𝜎2
𝜖
) ,
(8)
which must be accounted for in the GP model. If the observation noise is not known for each data point, this quantity must also be
estimated from the training data. The estimation of these hyperparameters is performed by maximising the marginal log-likelihood
(MLL) of the GP model. For these models, the integrated marginalised term is Gaussian which, in turn, allows the MLL to be expressed
analytically. In this work, we use the BoTorch package to estimate the hyperparameters of the GP model via a built-in L-BFGS-B
optimiser.
2.2.2. Acquisition functions
After constructing the probabilistic surrogate model for the objective function, the next step is to define an acquisition function
that guides the selection of the next sampling point. An acquisition function quantifies the utility of sampling a given point in the
design space. Classical acquisition functions include [48]:
Probability of Improvement (PI): Taking into account the posterior probability distribution, 𝑃, this acquisition computes the
probability that a point 𝜽improves the current optimum 𝑓∗= 𝑓(𝜽∗), that is [49],
𝛼PI (𝜽) = 𝑃(𝑓(𝜽) ≥𝑓∗) .
(9)
It should be remarked that this function returns the probability of any improvement of the function, regardless of its
magnitude. Thus, optimising with the PI generally emphasises exploitation, as points close to the current optimum have
higher probabilities of further improving the solution, even by a small amount.
Expected Improvement (EI): The expected improvement quantity can be computed by taking the expected value of the improve-
ment of the currently best-observed value over the posterior [50],
𝛼EI (𝜽) = E [max {0, 𝑓(𝜽) −𝑓∗}]
(10)
Unlike the PI acquisition, the expected improvement returns values that are dependent on the magnitude of the improvement
and, therefore, is generally more explorative than the PI. Nevertheless, it is accepted that the EI generally also favours
exploitation over exploration of the domain. To solve the problem of vanishing gradients for a large portion of the design
space, the Log Expected Improvement (LogEI) has been recently proposed [51]. In practice, LogEI retains the same properties
as the EI but is evaluated in a more numerically stable fashion in the logarithmic space, which has been shown to drastically
improve the performance of high-dimensional problems. In this work, this variant is preferred over the standard EI.
Upper Confidence Bound (UCB): This family of acquisition functions is derived from the concept of confidence bounds in
statistical analysis [52]. Frequently written for Gaussian posteriors, the upper confidence bound can be computed as
𝛼UCB (𝜽) = 𝜇(𝜽) + 𝛽 𝜎(𝜽) ,
(11)
where 𝜇(𝜽) and 𝜎(𝜽) are the posterior mean and standard deviation, and 𝛽is a user-defined hyperparameter. Higher values
favour exploration, whilst smaller ones promote exploitation.
All these functions can be evaluated analytically for Gaussian posteriors, which makes them particularly attractive for the Bayesian
optimisation framework. Examples of other relevant acquisition functions include the lookahead Knowledge Gradient (KG) [53,54],
as well as the entropy search (ES) [55] and the related predictive entropy search (PES) [56] and max-value entropy search
(MES) [57], which are not further explored in this work for the sake of brevity.
The choice of the next candidate point to sample is made by maximising the acquisition function over the design space. Since 𝛼(𝜽)
can be cheaply evaluated from the surrogate model, this step can be performed efficiently. Furthermore, since both the acquisition
Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering 434 (2025) 117516 
6 
R.P. Cardoso Coelho et al.
function and the GP are differentiable, the optimisation can be carried out with gradient-based methods. Notwithstanding, the
acquisition function is generally non-convex and the design space may contain multiple local optima. A robust approach is to use a
multi-restart gradient-based method to efficiently explore the design space and find the global optimum of the acquisition function.
In this work, the built-in optimiser of the BoTorch package is used to maximise the acquisition function, which adopts a multi-restart
L-BFGS-B algorithm.
2.3. Composite Bayesian optimisation
The objective function described in Eq. (4) is a scalar quantity that depends on the output of a numerical simulation. It has
been established as a composite function of the reduction function and the numerical response of the solver with the time and
data points 𝒕(𝜽) and 𝒀(𝜽). In this context, the reduction function is generally known through an analytical expression. Thus, this
function is generally cheap to evaluate and its derivatives can be computed. The non-differentiability of the objective function and its
time-consuming evaluation arises from the inner part of the composition, that is, the numerical simulation. The Bayesian optimisation
framework can be drastically improved by exploiting the composite nature of the objective function [15,43], as described throughout
this section. The main requirements for establishing the composite Bayesian optimisation framework are:
1. Adopt a transformation and its inverse −1 of the numerical simulation data 𝒕(𝜽) and 𝒀(𝜽) into a fixed-size vector 𝒑(𝜽)
defined on a latent response space;
2. Build a fixed-size vector-valued multi-output Gaussian process as the surrogate model for the outputs of the numerical
simulations 𝒑(𝜽) on the latent response space;
3. Leverage (quasi-)Monte Carlo methods to sample the posterior and evaluate the acquisition functions;
4. Establish the evaluation of the optimisation objective in terms of the latent response space samples 𝒑𝑞(𝜽), and, critically
allowing the gradients of this transformation to be evaluated;
5. Optionally, employ dimensionality reduction schemes, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to transform the latent
response space 𝒑(𝜽) into the reduced latent space ̂𝒑(𝜽).
In conjunction with Fig. 3, these steps constitute a high-level overview of the composite Bayesian optimisation framework. Each
of these ingredients is described in detail in Sections 2.3.1–2.3.5. As shown throughout the work, when embedded into the curve
optimisation problem for material design, the composite Bayesian optimisation framework has numerous advantages, namely:
• The entire response is observed by the optimiser instead of a single scalar objective value — this drastically reduces the loss
of information when computing the objective function;
• A surrogate model is built for the responses of the numerical simulation with multi-output Gaussian processes — leading to
an increased predicting ability of the surrogate model and allowing learning of the response space;
• The reduction function does not need to be learned by the surrogate model — this information is embedded in the evaluation
of the posterior of the objective function.
These advantages lead to an increase in optimisation performance, particularly in reducing the number of required function
evaluations. However, it should be remarked that the composite strategy is accompanied by an increase in the computational cost of
the optimiser. In the limit case, where the function call is expected to be the computational bottleneck, the increased optimisation
performance justifies the additional computational cost.
2.3.1. Transformation of the numerical simulation data
Due to the nature of the Bayesian optimisation framework, one is required to build a surrogate model for relevant quantities of the
numerical simulation. In the classical Bayesian optimisation framework, the surrogate model is built for the objective function 𝐽(𝜽),
which is a scalar quantity. However, to leverage the composition aspect of the objective function in the composite Bayesian
optimisation framework, we wish to build a surrogate model for the responses of the numerical simulations. From a broad perspective,
this requires constructing a dataset of the numerical simulation outputs 𝒕(𝜽) and 𝒀(𝜽). However, from a practical point of view, it
should not be assumed that the dimensionality of the discrete data points of 𝒕(𝜽) and 𝒀(𝜽) is fixed — it may vary from one simulation
to another.3 Therefore, consider a transformation that maps the numerical simulation data into a fixed-size vector 𝒑(𝜽),
𝒑(𝜽) = (𝒕(𝜽), 𝒀(𝜽)) ,
(12)
where the responses 𝒕(𝜽) and 𝒀(𝜽) are assumed to be of variable size and 𝒑(𝜽) is a fixed-size vector that represents the output
of the numerical simulation. It is assumed that the vector 𝒑(𝜽) is defined in the so-called latent response space. Furthermore, the
transformation must be invertible; that is, there exists an inverse transformation −1 such that
[𝒕(𝜽), 𝒀(𝜽)] = −1 (𝒑(𝜽)) .
(13)
Note that this last equivalence is not a strict equality, as the transformation may introduce some information loss. However,
considering an adequately designed transformation, it is assumed that this information loss is negligible in this work.
3 Several factors may contribute to this observation. For instance, the time grid may be sensitive to the parameters, or a sub-stepping strategy may introduce
variability in the number of discrete time points.

Fig. 3. High-level overview of the composite Bayesian optimisation framework.
Naturally, the choice of the transformation is problem-dependent. To showcase this point, we illustrate two options for the
transformation in the context of two different response optimisation scenarios, depicted in Fig. 4 and described here:
Curve Fitting - pointwise errors: In this scenario, we aim to compare the output of a numerical simulation with a set of reference
data points to find the set of parameters that better fit the reference data. In this case, since the reference grid is fixed, the
transformation can be defined as the computation of the pointwise errors 𝒆(𝜽) between the simulation and the reference
data, as described in detail in Cardoso Coelho et al. [15]. In this context, the objective function 𝐽(𝜽) is generally defined as
the sum of the squared pointwise errors, that is,
𝐽(𝜽) = 1
𝑁
𝑁
∑
𝑖=1
𝑒2
𝑖(𝜽) ,
(14)
where 𝑁is the number of data points in the reference grid, so that the minimisation of this function leads to the best fit
of the simulation to the reference data. Fig. 4(a) illustrates this scenario. With this setting, the latent response 𝒑(𝜽) has the
format
𝒑(𝜽) = [𝑒1 (𝜽) , 𝑒2 (𝜽) , … , 𝑒𝑁(𝜽)
] .
(15)
Response Design - endpoint interpolation: For general responses, the shape of the output of the numerical simulation may
vary significantly from one simulation to another. A simple strategy to address this issue is to interpolate the output of
the numerical simulation at a fixed set of 𝑁evenly spaced points between the initial and final time steps 𝑡min and 𝑡max,
respectively. Therefore, assuming 𝑦𝑖(𝜽) as the 𝑖th interpolated value, the latent response 𝒑(𝜽) can be defined as the
concatenation of the interpolated values with the endpoints of the time grid, that is,
𝒑(𝜽) = [𝑦1 (𝜽) , 𝑦2 (𝜽) , … , 𝑦𝑁(𝜽) , 𝑡min, 𝑡max
] ,
(16)
thus defining the latent response space with 𝑁+ 2 fixed dimensions. Naturally, this requires setting an appropriate value
for 𝑁so that the interpolation captures the relevant features of the output of the numerical simulation. Fig. 4(b) schematically
depicts this transformation. This strategy can then be easily reversed to obtain an approximation of the original response of
the numerical simulation.
This strategy allows the construction of a fixed-size vector for a single response curve. Notwithstanding, this can be easily
extended to multiple responses or full-field measurements by concatenating the latent response vectors into a single vector.
In piglot, this is implemented in the so-called ConcatUtility, which, given the sizes of each vector 𝒑(𝜽), handles the
concatenation and de-concatenation of the latent response vectors.
Remark 1. The transformation of the numerical simulation data into a fixed-size vector is a critical step in the composite Bayesian
optimisation framework. The choice of the transformation is problem-dependent and should be carefully designed to capture the

relevant features of the output of the numerical simulation. While the transformation for the curve fitting scenario is straightforward,
the transformation for the response design scenario requires a careful choice of the interpolation strategy. The transformation
adopted in this work has been shown to be effective for the classes of problems at hand, but it may pose limitations for responses
with severe differences in length or with varying length scales. While this topic is not further explored in this work due to brevity,
it remains an open research question. In addition, the number of interpolation points emerges as a hyperparameter that, at first
glance, needs to be carefully chosen to balance the computational cost of the optimisation and the accuracy of the surrogate model.
However, as demonstrated in Section 2.3.5, a PCA strategy completely mitigates the dependency on the computational cost. Thus,
the number 𝑁can be set to a high value without any significant increase in the computational cost.
2.3.2. Multi-output surrogate model
To model the response within of the latent response space, we employ a multi-output Gaussian process. Within this scope, since
our surrogate model must account for the multiple outputs of the numerical simulation, there are two main strategies to build the
multi-output Gaussian process:
1. Single Multi-task Gaussian process: In this approach, the vector-valued output of the numerical simulation is directly
modelled using a GP, so that the vector 𝒑(𝜽) is assumed to follow a multivariate normal distribution,
𝒑(𝜽) ∼(𝝁(𝜽), 𝜮(𝜽)) ,
(17)
where 𝝁(𝜽) is the vector-valued mean function and 𝜮(𝜽) is the covariance matrix. Since the outputs follow a multivariate
normal distribution, the correlation between the outputs is naturally accounted for. However, the computational cost of this
approach is significantly higher than the alternative.
2. Multiple Single-task Independent Gaussian processes: In this approach, a separate Gaussian process is built for each output
of the numerical simulation. As a consequence, the individual outputs are modelled independently, and are assumed to follow
a normal distribution with known mean and variance functions,
𝑝𝑖(𝜽) ∼(𝜇𝑖(𝜽), 𝜎2
𝑖(𝜽)
) ,
(18)
where 𝜇𝑖(𝜽) and 𝜎2
𝑖(𝜽) are the scalar-valued mean and variance functions of the 𝑖th output. Note that this strategy does
not consider the potential correlations between the outputs. However, for noiseless observations, it can be shown that the
independent models are equivalent to the multi-task Gaussian process — a property known as autokrigeability [58], which
is particularly useful in the context of this work. The main advantage of this approach is that the computational cost of
both training and inference is significantly lower than the multi-task Gaussian process, and can be easily batched for parallel
evaluation in the GPU.

R.P. Cardoso Coelho et al.
In this work, multiple single-task independent Gaussian processes are adopted as the surrogate model for the responses of the
numerical simulation. While the single multi-task Gaussian process is a more general approach, its increased computational cost
makes this strategy prohibitive for the high-dimensional problems considered in this work. As a final note, it should be remarked
that, while the autokrigeability property ensures that the surrogate models for the latent response space are equivalent, there is a
notable difference in the evaluation of the posterior for the objective function and, particularly, a dependency on the number of
points in the latent response space. This topic is described in more detail in Section 2.3.3.
2.3.3. Posterior of the objective function
Within the context of Bayesian optimisation, it is essential to estimate the posterior distribution of the objective function. In
classical Bayesian optimisation, the surrogate model is built for the objective function 𝐽(𝜽). Thus, the posterior distribution is known
and analytically computable — it is a Gaussian distribution. On the other hand, in the composite Bayesian optimisation framework,
the posterior for the objective function is not directly available — while 𝒑(𝜽) is assumed to be Gaussian, the distribution of 𝐽(𝜽)
cannot be directly inferred.
In the composite setting, the standard approach for estimating the posterior distribution of the objective function is via Monte
Carlo sampling. To this end, for a given point 𝜽𝑞, a set of 𝑄samples 𝒑𝑞
(𝜽𝑞
) is drawn from the posterior distribution of the latent
response space, that is,
𝒑𝑞
(𝜽𝑞
) ∼(𝝁(𝜽𝑞), 𝜮(𝜽𝑞)) .
(19)
Then, the samples need to be transformed back to the original response space, that is,
[𝒕𝑞
(𝜽𝑞
) , 𝒀𝑞
(𝜽𝑞
)] = −1 (𝒑𝑞
(𝜽𝑞
)) ,
(20)
where 𝒕𝑞
(𝜽𝑞
) and 𝒀𝑞
(𝜽𝑞
) are the transformed samples of the time grid and the output of the numerical simulation. Finally, the
objective function 𝐽(𝜽𝑞) is evaluated for each of these samples through Eq. (4),
𝐽𝑞(𝜽𝑞) = (𝜽𝑞, 𝒕𝑞
(𝜽𝑞
) , 𝒀𝑞
(𝜽𝑞
)) ,
(21)
where the samples 𝐽𝑞(𝜽𝑞) are assumed to be drawn from the posterior distribution of the objective function and can be used
for its estimation. While these samples should be sufficient for fitting a known probability distribution, in practice, as shown in
Section 2.3.4, the acquisition functions can be directly evaluated from these samples efficiently.
As a final note, as highlighted in Section 2.3.4, it is particularly useful to compute the gradients of the objective function with
respect to the input parameters to allow an efficient optimisation of the acquisition functions. In the context of the composite
Bayesian optimisation framework, the gradients of the objective function can be computed by the chain rule, that is,
𝜕 𝐽𝑞
𝜕𝜽𝑞
= 𝜕
𝜕𝜽𝑞
+ 𝜕
𝜕𝒕𝑞
𝜕𝒕𝑞
𝜕𝜽𝑞
+ 𝜕
𝜕𝒀𝑞
𝜕𝒀𝑞
𝜕𝜽𝑞
.
(22)
The gradients of the reduction function are assumed to be known, and the gradients of the response quantities 𝒕𝑞
(𝜽𝑞
) and 𝒀𝑞
(𝜽𝑞
)
can be computed by the inverse transformation −1, that is,
[ 𝜕𝒕𝑞
𝜕𝜽𝑞
,
𝜕𝒀𝑞
𝜕𝜽𝑞
]
= 𝜕−1
𝜕𝒑𝑞
𝜕𝒑𝑞
𝜕𝜽𝑞
.
(23)
Finally, the gradient of the latent response space 𝒑𝑞
(𝜽𝑞
) with respect to the input parameters 𝜽𝑞is assumed to be computable via
the surrogate model.4 Thus, both the gradients of the reduction function and of the inverse transformation −1 are required to
compute the gradients of the objective function.5 In piglot, these gradients are not explicitly computed; instead, the functions 
and −1 are written in terms of PyTorch operations, which allows the automatic differentiation via backpropagation. This approach
allows increased flexibility in the definition of the reduction function and the transformation. As a final note, these functions are
designed to allow their evaluation for large batches of points, so that the computation can be efficiently parallelised.
Before proceeding, it is worth highlighting that when adopting the multiple single-task independent Gaussian processes as the
surrogate model for the responses of the numerical simulation, the components of the latent response space are assumed to be
independent. Due to autokrigeability, this assumption is equivalent to the multi-task Gaussian process in the noise-free scenario, so
that the model can learn the same information as the multi-task model. However, a critical difference arises when sampling from
the posterior distribution of the latent response space: the samples of 𝒑(𝜽) are independent and do not reflect possible correlations
between them. This has the hidden consequence that the posterior of the objective function 𝐽(𝜽) becomes sensitive to the number of
points in the latent response space; from the central limit theorem, as the number of points increases, the posterior standard deviation
should decrease proportionally to 1∕
√
𝑁, while the mean should remain unaffected. Therefore, even if the reduction function is
independent of the number of points, the posterior of the objective function and, consequently, the Bayesian optimisation process
are dependent on the number of points in the latent response space. To mitigate this issue, two approaches can be considered:
4 Note that these are the derivatives of the surrogate model, not of the numerical response. For Gaussian processes, these gradients are often easily computable.
The gradient of the original numerical response does not need to be known.
5 Note that, with this approach, the gradients of the forward transformation do not need to be computed.

1. Multivariate normal sampler: Instead of using independent samplers for each component of 𝑝(𝜽), a multivariate normal
sampler can be used to sample the latent response space. To this end, the covariance matrix of the latent response space must
be estimated from the training data. Broadly speaking, this is similar to using Eq. (19) for sampling, with 𝝁(𝜽𝑞
) and 𝜮(𝜽𝑞
)
estimated from the training data and Eq. (18). Naturally, there is an increase in the computational cost when using this
strategy.
2. Dimensionality reduction to weakly correlated features: A more efficient approach is to reduce the dimensionality of the
latent response space to a set of weakly correlated features. This can be achieved by employing dimensionality reduction
techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to transform the latent response space 𝒑(𝜽) into a reduced latent
space ̂𝒑(𝜽) where the components are not strongly correlated and can be assumed to be independent. This strategy is described
in more detail in Section 2.3.5.
2.3.4. Evaluating acquisition functions
By definition, an acquisition function is a utility function that quantifies the value of sampling a given point in the design
space. This requires the knowledge of the posterior probability distribution of the objective function 𝐽(𝜽) to optimise, which has
been described in Section 2.3.3. In the composite setting, it is not practical to estimate the posterior distribution of the objective
function directly; alternatively the acquisition functions can be evaluated from the samples of the latent response space. This can
be easily accomplished by establishing the acquisition functions an expectation over some quantity computed from the samples of
the objective function and evaluating via Monte Carlo, that is,
𝛼(𝜽) = E [𝛼(𝝃) |𝝃∼𝐽(𝜽)] ≈1
𝑄
𝑄
∑
𝑞=1
𝛼(𝐽𝑞(𝜽)) ,
(24)
where 𝑄is the number of samples drawn for the Monte Carlo estimation. From the family of acquisitions in Section 2.2.2, only the
EI is derived from an expectation that can be trivially computed with Monte Carlo. For the PI and UCB, as shown in Wilson et al.
[59], Cardoso Coelho et al. [15], they can be written as expectations according to the following transformations:
𝛼PI (𝜽) = E [𝐻(max {0, 𝑓(𝜽) −𝑓∗})] ,
(25)
𝛼UCB (𝜽) = E
[
𝜇(𝜽) + 𝛽
√
𝜋
2 | ̂𝑦(𝜽) −𝜇(𝜽)|
]
,
(26)
where 𝐻is the Heaviside step function and ̃𝑦(𝜽) is a sample from the posterior distribution of the objective function. In addition,
the gradients of these acquisitions can be computed using the reparameterisation trick, as described by Wilson et al. [59]. Thus,
with this procedure, the acquisitions can be efficiently evaluated using the samples from the posterior obtained with the procedure
in Section 2.3.3, and the objective posterior does not need to be explicitly evaluated.
In practice, the evaluation of the acquisition function and its derivatives requires a series of steps, as illustrated in Fig. 5. For
a given parameter 𝜽, the samples of the latent response space 𝒑𝑞(𝜽) are drawn from their posterior distribution at 𝜽. Then, the
samples are transformed back to the original response space 𝒕𝑞(𝜽) and 𝒀𝑞(𝜽) by the inverse transformation −1. At this stage, these
quantities can be interpreted as several Monte Carlo samples of possible numerical responses for the given parameters 𝜽. Finally,
the objective function 𝐽𝑞(𝜽) is evaluated for each response sample, and the acquisition function is computed from the expectation
in Eq. (24). As all of these operations are implemented using PyTorch tensors, both (i) the gradients are automatically computed via
backpropagation6 and (ii) the computations can be efficiently parallelised for multiples batches of points 𝜽. These aspects strongly
motivate using multi-start gradient-based optimisation methods to maximise the acquisition functions,7 as described in Section 2.2.2.
Regarding the sampling of the posterior, two additional improvements are employed to improve the efficiency of the method.
Firstly, the samples of the latent response space are drawn using a quasi-Monte Carlo (q-MC) method based on Sobol sequences,
which helps to reduce the variance of the Monte Carlo estimation. Then, as described by Balandat et al. [46], fixed base samples
are used for the sampling, which increases the smoothness of q-MC evaluated acquisitions. This allows for increased efficiency in
the optimisation of these functions with gradient-based methods, at the cost of a small bias in their function values. In this work,
the BoTorch package is used to evaluate the acquisition functions, which automatically handles the q-MC sampling and the fixed
base samples.
2.3.5. Dimensionality reduction with PCA
In the context of data-driven strategies, it is very common to carry an intermediate step of dimensionality reduction to reduce the
number of features in the dataset. One of the most popular techniques for linear dimensionality reduction is Principal Component
Analysis (PCA). At its core, the PCA algorithm aims to project the original data into a new space defined by the principal components
(PC), which are the set of orthogonal directions that maximise the explained variance of the original data. The main steps for this
strategy are depicted in Fig. 6 and can be summarised as follows:
6 The backpropagation for the posterior sampling stage requires the reparameterisation trick [60].
7 Parallelism can be exploited by both the initial candidate generation stage and the concurrent running of gradient-based optimisation on multiple points.

Fig. 6. Illustration of the PCA transformation in the composite Bayesian optimisation framework.
1. Standardise the data and get covariance matrix: It is well established that PCA should only be used with zero-mean data
and, furthermore, that the data should be scaled to have unit variance. Therefore, the data is first standardised to ensure these
properties are met. Then, the covariance matrix 𝜮of the standardised data is computed to infer the correlation between the
different features.
2. Find the principal components: Given the covariance matrix 𝜮, the eigenvalues 𝜆𝑖and eigenvectors 𝒗𝑖are computed. The
principal components are the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix, and the eigenvalues represent the amount of variance
explained by each component. Using the eigenvalues, the principal components are then ordered by decreasing variance. The
eigenvectors are the orthogonal set of directions that maximise the variance of the data.
3. Project to the lower dimensionality space: Finally, with the principal components ordered, we can choose the first 𝑘
components that, cumulated, explain a certain portion of the total variance of the data. Having 𝑘selected, the 𝑁× 𝑘
transformation matrix 𝑾is built with the first 𝑘eigenvectors,
𝑾= [𝒗1, 𝒗2, … , 𝒗𝑘
] .
(27)
With this matrix, any point in the latent response space 𝒑(𝜽) can be projected to the reduced latent space ̂𝒑(𝜽) by the matrix
multiplication,
̂𝒑(𝜽) = 𝒑(𝜽) 𝑾,
(28)
together with the reverse transformation,
𝒑(𝜽) = ̂𝒑(𝜽) 𝑾𝑇.
(29)
In piglot, PCA is employed to reduce the dimensionality of the latent response space 𝒑(𝜽) to a reduced latent space ̂𝒑(𝜽). The
transformation is recomputed at every iteration of the Bayesian optimisation, and the number of components 𝑘can change from one
iteration to another. As highlighted in Cardoso Coelho et al. [15], the computational cost of the composite Bayesian optimisation
is highly sensitive to the number of points in the latent response space, so it is critical to carry out this dimensionality reduction.
Furthermore, one advantage of this procedure is that, in the worst-case scenario, all the principal components are selected and the
original latent response space is preserved. In addition, the PCA transforms the space into a set of uncorrelated features that can be
assumed to be independent, thus mitigating some of the issues raised in Section 2.3.3 for the single-task models. Finally, since the
reduced latent space is a linear transformation of the original latent response space, the gradients of the objective function can be
easily computed in the reduced latent space and transformed back to the original latent response space. Recalling the acquisition
function evaluation flowchart in Fig. 5, the PCA transformation is carried out between the sampling of the posterior of the objective

function and the inverse transformation of the response, leading to the diagram depicted in Fig. 7. Therefore, this component can
be easily introduced in the procedure without significant changes to the overall workflow. The impact of this PCA transformation
is discussed in Section 3.2, along with a parametric study concerning the unexplained PCA variance threshold.
2.4. Multi-objective Bayesian optimisation
Up to this point, the Bayesian optimisation framework has been described for the single-objective case. However, in many
engineering problems, the optimisation is characterised by multiple objectives that need to be simultaneously optimised, i.e., solving
a multi-objective optimisation problem. In this scope, considering a set of 𝑚objectives, the optimisation problem can be defined as
max
𝜽∈
[𝐽1(𝜽), 𝐽2(𝜽), … , 𝐽𝑚(𝜽)] ,
(30)
where 𝐽𝑖(𝜽) is the 𝑖th objective function. Note that, for notational convenience, the problem has been written as the maximisation
of all objectives, but it can instead involve the minimisation of some objectives.8 In the multi-objective scenario, there is generally
no single solution 𝜽∗that is optimal for all objectives; instead, in these problems, we seek to find the so-called Pareto front of the
problem. The Pareto front is defined in the objective space and, broadly speaking, denotes the regions where the improvement of
one objective leads to the worsening of another. A solution 𝜽1 dominates another solution 𝜽2 if it improves at least one objective
without worsening any other. Therefore, a solution that lies in the Pareto front is referred to as Pareto optimal or non-dominated,
while others are known as dominated.
Bayesian optimisation can be used to solve the multi-objective optimisation problem. In this context, it can be shown that finding
the Pareto front of the problem is equivalent to maximising its hypervolume indicator [61,62], which is the 𝑚-dimensional volume
between the region dominated by the Pareto front and a reference point [63]. Naturally, this allows the problem to be cast into a
single-objective case, with hypervolume as the objective function. This approach allows the construction of the so-called Expected
Hypervolume Improvement (EHVI) acquisition function, which is the multi-objective counterpart of the Expected Improvement
(EI) acquisition function.9 There are known challenges in the evaluation of the hypervolume and its derivatives, particularly in
high-dimensional problems, which require a partitioning of the objective space into hyper-rectangles. In this work, we adopt the
EHVI acquisition function described in Daulton et al. [66], which allows the efficient and exact computation of the hypervolume
and its gradients and the subsequent acquisition evaluation through Monte Carlo sampling. For noisy objective observations, the
Noisy Expected Hypervolume Improvement (NEHVI) acquisition function can also be explored [67]. A schematic representation of
the relevant concepts in multi-objective Bayesian optimisation is depicted in Fig. 8.
3. Hyperparameter estimation
Throughout Sections 2.2 and 2.3, the Bayesian optimisation strategy and its composite counterpart have been introduced and,
crucially, two hyperparameters arose from the discussion: (i) the number of initial DoE points and (ii) the unexplained PCA variance
threshold. Note that, while the budget for function evaluations needs to be defined by the user, this is considered a design choice
rather than a hyperparameter. In this section, we discuss the estimation of the two hyperparameters mentioned above, which are
crucial for the performance of the optimisation strategy.
8 Alternatively, to mimic minimisation, we can maximise the negated objective.
9 Other variants using the Probability of Improvement [64] and the Knowledge Gradient [65] acquisitions for hypervolume optimisation have also been
explored in the literature, which, for brevity, have not been considered in this work.

in the represented domain. The initial guess refers to the midpoint of every optimisation dimension, whilst the optimised response has been selected from one
of the realisations. In addition, some random samples are shown for comparison.
A numerical example has been adopted for the parametric studies of these hyperparameters. To allow for a varying number of
dimensions in the design space, the following objective is considered:

𝜃𝑖+𝑛∈[𝑖− 1, 𝑖] ,
∀𝑖∈{1, 2, … , 𝑛} .
(32)
Therefore, with this approach, depending on the parameter 𝑛, the design space is defined by the number of dimensions 2𝑛. Some
examples of responses generated for different values of 𝜽are shown in Fig. 9 for different values of 𝑛. All the optimisations were
performed using composite Bayesian optimisation strategy, the LogEI acquisition function and a budget of 128 function evaluations.

Fig. 10. Median, maximum and minimum best observed objective value for different numbers of initial DoE points for the four different problems.
3.1. Number of initial DoE points
For the selection of the number of initial DoE points, a parametric study has been conducted with the number of initial DoE
points varying from 4 to 32. In addition, according to the definition in Eq. (31), the number of dimensions in the design space has
been varied from 4 to 16 by choosing 𝑛between 2 and 8. This combination accounts for a total of 16 different problems and, for
each, 20 realisations have been performed. In addition, PCA has been used with a threshold of 10−6 for the unexplained variance
and 32 points are used for the discretisation of the numerical response.
The convergence of the median, maximum and minimum best observed objective values are shown in Fig. 10 for the four different
problems and the four different numbers of initial DoE points. It can be observed that the median objective value generally converges
for all of the problems. However, as the number of dimensions increases, the convergence is slower, and the number of initial
DoE points has a more significant impact on the convergence. By visual inspection, the best median objective arises when 𝑛init is
increased, at the cost of a slower initial convergence due to additional random points. To further investigate this, the quantitative
results are shown in Table 1 for the median best-observed loss, its minimum and maximum values, and the cumulative regret of
the optimisation. The cumulative regret is calculated as the integral along the function calls axis of the difference between the
best-observed objective value for the problem and its current value, and we seek to minimise this quantity [15]. The results further
reinforce the visual inspection, showing that the best median objective value is generally obtained with a larger number of initial
DoE points, but the convergence is slower — as evidenced by the higher cumulative regret. Notwithstanding, these effects are more
pronounced as the number of dimensions increases and, for lower dimensional problems, the solution seems to be less sensitive to
the number of initial DoE points.
With these results, it is possible to conclude that the number of initial DoE points has a significant impact on the optimisation
performance. Particularly, it plays a critical role in the so-called exploration–exploitation tradeoff of Bayesian optimisation,
particularly for high-dimensional problems. The results suggest that the number of initial DoE points should be increased as the

number of dimensions increases, but this should be balanced so as not to slow down the convergence of the optimisation. With this
in mind, the following heuristic based on the number of optimisation dimensions 𝑛dim is adopted for this work:
𝑛init =
{
8,
if 𝑛dim ≤4,
2𝑛dim,
otherwise,
(33)
that is, the number of initial points is the largest, between 8 and twice the number of dimensions in the design space. As evidenced in
the results in Table 1, this heuristic provides a good balance between the exploration and exploitation of the design space, leading
to a good convergence of the optimisation. Even so, the user should be aware that this heuristic is problem-dependent and, for
specific cases, a different number of initial DoE points might be more appropriate. As a final note, since it is typical to have some
domain knowledge of a good initial guess for the design parameters, we also consider the addition of this initial guess to the initial
DoE. Thus, in practice, a dataset of 𝑛init + 1 is used in this work for the upcoming examples.
3.2. Unexplained PCA variance threshold
To showcase the impact of the PCA transformation in the optimisation procedure, an experiment is carried out by selecting 𝑛= 4
in Eq. (31). As a result, the input design space comprises 8 dimensions and is characterised by the optimisation of the integral of
a response 𝑓(𝜽, 𝑡) over the interval [0, 4], and aims to mimic the optimisation of a response curve. To use the composite Bayesian
optimisation framework, the response 𝑓(𝜽, 𝑡) must be transformed into a fixed-size vector according to the procedure described in
Section 2.3.1. Particularly, the transformation depicted in Fig. 4(b) is adopted; therefore, the number of points for the interpolation
of the response needs to be defined. In this experiment, the number of points varies from 8 to 128 on a logarithmic scale, and
the integration is carried out numerically using a trapezoidal rule. Furthermore, the optimisation is carried out with and without
the PCA transformation, and a value of 10−6 is selected as the threshold for the unexplained variance. Using 20 realisations, the
median values for the best-observed objective value and the computational time after 128 function evaluations are presented in
Fig. 11, along with their respective 95 % confidence intervals. The optimisation quality improves with PCA — the best objective
value is higher and with a smaller dispersion, particularly for increasing numbers of points. This observation is justified by the
remark in Section 2.3.3 that the posterior variance of the objective function is inversely proportional to the number of points
in the latent response space and, therefore, the search becomes overly exploitative and may converge to a local optimum. Using
PCA for this example, the number of principal components (PC) is usually 8 and seems insensitive to the number of interpolation
points, which significantly emphasises exploration when compared to the non-PCA scenario. Finally, there is a notable reduction
in the computational time when using PCA, which, in combination with the previous topics, largely justifies the use of PCA in the
composite Bayesian optimisation framework.
As a concluding remark, while the PCA transformation is an optional component of the composite Bayesian optimisation
framework, it has been shown to be crucial to improve the optimisation quality and efficiency. For this reason, it is applied to
the remaining experiments in this work. The choice of the variance threshold is discussed in Section 3.2. By efficiently using this
technique, the following advantages are achieved:
• The dimensionality of the latent response space is reduced, which drastically reduces the computational cost of the method;
• The reduced latent space is composed of uncorrelated features, which allows the assumption of independence between the
components of the latent response space and, therefore, allows using multiple independent single-task Gaussian processes. This
has been observed to improve the exploration-exploitation balance of the optimisation and the convergence of the method;

• In the curve design scenario, the hyperparameter 𝑁can be set to a high value without a significant increase in the
computational cost — the PCA automatically selects the number of appropriate components in the reduced latent space.
For completeness, the same problem is optimised with the PCA transformation, but now for a varying threshold for the
unexplained variance. Choosing the number of points for the interpolation as 32, the optimisation is carried out with logarithmic-
spaced thresholds from 10−2 to 10−7, whose results for 20 realisations are presented in Table 2. As expected, the number of principal
components and computational time are correlated with the threshold for the unexplained variance — the smaller the threshold, the
more components are required to explain the variance of the data and, consequently, the higher the computational cost. Furthermore,
larger thresholds lead to a worsening of the optimisation quality due to an increasing information loss during the PCA transformation.
In this example, the threshold of 10−6 is selected as a conservative compromise between optimisation quality and computational
cost, and is used for the remaining experiments in this work.
4. Examples
Throughout this section, a comparative analysis of the proposed composite Bayesian optimisation strategy is conducted for
distinct material and structural design problems. This strategy is compared with three other baseline optimisers in the literature,
namely:
Classical Bayesian optimisation: the standard Bayesian optimisation strategy for the black-box function 𝐽(𝜽). For this task, we
use a BoTorch implementation of the method, similar to the composite setting, which shares both the same number of initial
design points and acquisition functions.
Random sampling: a naive random sampling strategy based on Sobol sequences for exploration of the design space. All function
evaluations are conducted with random points, and the best-observed solution is tracked throughout the optimisation
procedure.

Fig. 12. Schematic representation of the modifications to the Bessa surrogate strategy to ease the comparison with the remaining methods.
Bessa surrogate: the design strategy proposed by Bessa and coworkers [24], which uses a surrogate model to guide the design
problem. This framework is aimed at the class of problems where the objective function may not be known beforehand,
since the optimisation is only carried out at a later stage without requiring re-evaluating the objective function. We include
this approach in the comparative study to highlight the increased efficiency in optimisation when the objective function is
known and we guide the sampling process towards finding the optimum. This strategy requires:
1. Generation of an initial dataset using DoE strategies, such as Sobol sequences. This step requires evaluating the
objective function for each DoE point and it is assumed that the entire budget for function evaluations has been
allocated for this task.
2. Construction of a surrogate model for the observations of the objective function. Various options are available for
this task, such as Gaussian processes, neural networks, or support vector machines. Nevertheless, in this work, we
use a Gaussian process model for the surrogate due to its straightforward training and availability using the BoTorch
package.
3. Optimisation of the surrogate model to find the optimal solution. As before, several methods are available for this
step, and depending on the chosen model, even gradient-based methods can be considered. For integration with our
Bayesian optimisation framework, we use the same gradient-based multi-start L-BFGS-B optimiser to find the optimal
posterior mean of the Gaussian process surrogate. Note that this optimisation is generally cheap, so less sample-efficient
methods such as particle swarm and genetic algorithms can also be considered.
Additionally, since we intend to assess the convergence quality of this method, a variant of this framework is considered
to ease the comparison with the remaining methods. Firstly, to lessen the computational cost of the examples, we use the
dataset generated by the random sampling optimiser as the DoE for the Bessa surrogate.10 Secondly, since the optimal point is
obtained from optimising the surrogate model and, therefore, can be considered as a low-fidelity sample, we re-evaluate the
optimal point using the true objective function to ensure a fair comparison with the remaining methods. Finally, to be able to
compare convergence rates, one is required to have the history for the evaluated objectives 𝐽(𝜽). Since this approach assumes
that the optimisation only occurs after the DoE dataset is built, that is, after the budget of function evaluations is exhausted,
we simulate stopping the generation of the DoE dataset and optimising the Bessa surrogate. In other words, at the 𝑖th iteration,
a surrogate model is built using only the first 𝑖DoE points. Then, the optimal point is found using the surrogate model, and
the true objective function is evaluated. This procedure is repeated until the budget for function evaluations is exhausted. A
schematic representation of the modifications to the Bessa surrogate strategy is illustrated in Fig. 12. This allows extracting
the convergence history 𝐽(𝜽𝑖
) of the Bessa surrogate strategy and comparing it with the remaining methods.
Since all methods share randomness in the initial design points, each design problem is repeated 20 times for each method to ensure
the statistical significance of the results. Similarly to the work of Cardoso Coelho et al. [15], we focus on the median of the various
metrics from the optimisation procedure, as well as their 95 % confidence intervals, to assess the performance of the different design
strategies. The confidence interval for the median, for a sample size of 𝑛= 20, is between the observations 𝑛𝑞± 𝑧
√
𝑛𝑞(1 −𝑞), in the
ordered sample data, being 𝑞the quantile of interest (𝑞= 0.5 for the median) and 𝑧the z-critical value, which for a 95 % confidence
interval is 𝑧= 1.96 [68].
Finally, to ensure an adequate coverage of the class of problems of interest, we consider four distinct design problems. These
problems encompass: (i) the optimisation of an analytical response to maximise the integral of a function (see Section 4.1), (ii) the
10 Note that this option does not degrade the performance of this method in any way; it simply avoids regenerating a DoE dataset from scratch for the two
optimisers.

identification of the hardening parameters of a 3D inelastic particle-matrix RVE (see Section 4.2), (iii) the identification of structural
parameters of a compression–torsion coupling metamaterial (see Section 4.3) and (iv) the identification of 16 structural parameters
of a bending beam (see Section 4.4). All these examples have been optimised with piglot [44]. In addition, unless otherwise
stated, the numerical simulations are conducted with the in-house finite element code Links (Large Strain Implicit Nonlinear
Analysis of Solids Linking Scales), which allows for solving both macroscopic and microscopic single-scale problems, as well as
coupled multi-scale problems at large strains.
4.1. Design of an analytical response
To showcase the performance of the proposed composite Bayesian optimisation strategy, we start by recalling the optimisation
of the analytical response described in Section 3, characterised by the objective function given in Eq. (31) with 𝑛= 4. This eight-
dimensional optimisation problem focuses on the maximisation of the integral of the function. For each optimiser, 20 realisations
have been conducted to extract statistical information about the performance of the different methods. In this comparative example,
we focus on finding the number of function evaluations required for the optimiser to reach a given target objective value, as well as
the associated success rate. Therefore, an arbitrarily large budget of function evaluations is considered for each optimiser, which has
also been adjusted to avoid a high computational cost — BO approaches are limited to 128 function evaluations, Bessa’s surrogate
strategy to 512 and the random sampling to 1024.
The results for this design problem are compiled in Fig. 13. On the left-hand side, the relationship between an objective value and
the median number of function evaluations required to reach this objective value is illustrated. For this example, 95 % confidence
intervals are considered for both the dispersion of the function calls and the cutoff point for the objective value.11 The best-observed
objective value for all optimisers and realisations is also depicted. These results reinforce the sample efficiency of the Bayesian
optimisation strategies and, particularly, how the composite strategy drastically outperforms the remaining methods. For certain
target objective values, the composite strategy may require a full order of magnitude fewer function evaluations than the Bessa
surrogate method. Finally, on the right-hand side of the figure, the success rate for reaching a given objective value is illustrated. In
this figure, the objective value is quantified by the distance to the best-observed objective of the 20 realisations for all optimisers,
which allows for a more accurate comparison when approaching the presumably optimal solution. It can be observed that the
composite strategy retains a significantly higher success rate as the objective value increases than the remaining methods. As a
concluding remark, this example demonstrates the increased sample-efficiency of the composite Bayesian optimisation strategy,
which allows for reaching target objective values with fewer function evaluations than the remaining methods.
11 This indicates that the maximum values depicted in this plot are not necessarily the best-observed objective values by a given optimiser; the maximum
value in the plot is related to the appropriate quantile for computing the confidence interval.

4.2. Design of a 3D inelastic particle-matrix RVE
In this example, a three-dimensional particle-matrix RVE is considered to identify two hardening parameters of the particles
to maximise the toughness of the composite material, inspired by the work of Bessa et al. [24]. The RVE is assumed to be
composed of 10 randomly distributed periodic spherical particles, with a particle volume fraction of 20 %, where a voxel grid of
80 × 80 × 80 is considered, as illustrated in Fig. 14. Furthermore, the RVE is generated with the in-house microstructure generation
program for particle-reinforced materials, GMMD, based on an adaptive multi-temperature isokinetic time-driven molecular dynamics
scheme [69]. To match the original example in Bessa et al. [24], for this case, all the numerical simulations are conducted with the
SCA clustering-based reduced-order model, available as an open-source package, CRATE [70].
Both phases of the composite material are assumed inelastic following the von Mises elasto-plastic model, with a hardening law
given by
𝜎𝑌= 𝜎𝑌 ,0 + 𝛽1 (̄𝜀𝑝)𝛽2 ,
(34)
where ̄𝜀𝑝is the accumulated plastic strain, 𝜎𝑌 ,0 is the initial yield stress and 𝛽1 and 𝛽2 are two hardening parameters. The material
properties for each phase are compiled in Table 3, where the parameters 𝑎and 𝑏are related to the yielding and hardening
parameters 𝜎𝑌 ,0 and 𝛽1 of the particles, respectively. Additionally, a simple fracture model is adopted [24]:
• The composite fails when 10 % of the matrix phase reaches a maximum strain component of 0.07;
• The material is considered brittle;
• The particles are considered to fail at a significantly higher strain level, thus the composite failure is uniquely due to the matrix
failure.
In this example, the two hardening parameters 𝑎and 𝑏of a three-dimensional particle-matrix RVE are optimised to maximise
the toughness of this composite material, that is,
max

𝐽(𝜽) = max

where the toughness 𝑈T of the composite material is defined as the integral of the stress–strain curve obtained in a uniaxial tension
test before fracture. Using a trapezoidal rule for approximating the integral, the toughness is calculated as

where 𝜀𝑓is the fracture strain, 𝜎(𝜀) is the stress–strain curve, and 𝑛is the number of points in the stress–strain curve.12
Considering the stress–strain curve as the output of the response functional , we can identify the compositional nature of the
objective function via
𝐽(𝑎, 𝑏) = (𝑎, 𝑏, [𝑎, 𝑏]) = Trapz ([𝑎, 𝑏]) ,
(37)
where the trapezoidal rule is denoted by the operator Trapz, given by,
Trapz ([𝑎, 𝑏]) =
𝑛
∑
𝑖=1
𝜎𝑖+ 𝜎𝑖−1

(𝜀𝑖−𝜀𝑖−1

(38)
whose gradients are computable. By adopting this composition, the composite Bayesian optimisation strategy observes the entire
stress–strain curve of the RVE, and the objective is computed using the reduction function . This format explicitly highlights the
composition of the objective function, where the inner part is the numerical response of the simulation.
The following bounds are considered for the two input design variables:
𝑎= [10, 700] MPa, 
𝑏= [50, 2000] MPa.
(39)
In addition, the initial values of 𝑎= 350 MPa and 𝑏= 1000 MPa are adopted. It is worth emphasising that the complexity of this
design problem is a result of two competing factors, namely the ductility and the strength of the composite material. Both these
phenomena strongly affect the overall toughness of the material. In particular, if the particles are characterised by a high yield
strength and hardening, the strength of the composite material increases, but the ductility decreases due to a high concentration of
strain in the matrix phase. In contrast, if the particles have low yield strength and hardening, the ductility of the material increases
at the expense of decreasing its strength. Likewise, it is of utmost interest to find a compromise between the strength and ductility
of the particles so that the composite material has maximum toughness.
The results for this design problem are compiled in Fig. 15. The maximum number of function evaluations for each optimiser are
defined by — BO approaches are limited to 159 function evaluations, Bessa’s surrogate strategy to 1026 and the random sampling to
1025. In Fig. 15(a), the median toughness evolution (𝑈T) for the different design strategies is illustrated along with the corresponding
95% confidence bounds. In Fig. 15(b), the stress–strain response of the 3D inelastic RVE and its corresponding toughness value are
represented for three different sets of parameters.
12 Note that the dependency of the fracture strain and the stress–strain curve on the parameters 𝑎and 𝑏has been dropped, for notational convenience.

Fig. 16. Distribution of the optimal hardening parameters obtained by the different design strategies in 20 runs of the optimisation problem. Recall that the
bounds for the parameters are: 𝑎∈ [10, 700] MPa and 𝑏∈ [50, 2000] MPa.
From these results, it is observed that, as expected, the increase of both hardening parameters promotes the increase of strength
of the material at the expense of decreasing its ductility. Moreover, it is observed that, from the four design strategies, the
composite Bayesian optimisation strategy consistently finds the best solution for this design problem, pinpointing the hardening
parameters that provide higher toughness of the material. In addition to its excellent accuracy, this strategy demonstrates low
variance between different runs. In contrast, the Bessa surrogate design strategy is not as accurate as the Bayesian optimisation
techniques, independently of the number of points in the initial dataset. Recall that while the BO strategies leverage the information
of the objective function to guide the design problem, the Bessa surrogate employs a larger initial dataset (not guided by the design
objective), which is then cheaply optimised.
In Fig. 16, the distribution of the optimal hardening parameters obtained by the different design strategies in 20 runs of
the optimisation procedure is illustrated. From these results, the consistency of the composite Bayesian optimisation is again
demonstrated, with all optimal solutions falling within the same region of the design input space. Moreover, it is observed that
the classical Bayesian optimisation demonstrates some variation between different runs, and that due to the elevated number of
function evaluations, both the Bessa surrogate strategy and the Random Sampling strategy provide similar optimal distributions.
Notably, almost all optimal solutions are contained in the lower bound of the 𝑏hardening parameter. Recall that the bounds for
the parameters are: 𝑎= [10, 700] MPa and 𝑏= [50, 2000] MPa, which suggests that the lower bound of the 𝑏parameter should be
reduced. However, in the present contribution, the bounds of the parameters are kept equal to the ones adopted by Bessa et al.
[24].
4.3. Design of structural parameters of a compression–torsion coupling metamaterial
This example focuses on the geometric optimisation of a three-dimensional RVE of a chiral compression–torsion coupling (CTC)
metamaterial with inclined rods, as described in the work of [71]. Due to these inclined rods, the RVE exhibits macroscopic
compression–torsion coupling behaviour — compressive loadings induce torsion relative to the compression axis. The unit cell
is composed of two square loops with four inclined rods connecting their vertices, as depicted in Fig. 17. The rods are inclined at
an angle 𝜃relative to the x–y plane, and the side length of the square loops is denoted as 𝑙𝜇. The thickness 𝑡is specified by the
parameter 𝛽, which is a scalar coefficient computed as the ratio of the thickness, 𝑡, to the side length of the square loop, 𝑙𝜇,
𝛽= 𝑡
𝑙𝜇
.
(40)
While the square loops feature a quadrangular cross-section with side 𝑡, the thickness of the tie-rods is dependent on the angle 𝜃
and is given by 𝑡sin 𝜃. Additionally, two different materials are considered for each of these components, where the square loops are

assumed to be rigid and the inclined rods are deformable beams [72,73]. For all of these examples, it is assumed that the bottom
square loop is fixed, whilst the top square loop has a prescribed displacement in the z-direction but is free to move and rotate in
the other directions.
For this problem, two geometric parameters are considered as design variables: the angle of the inclined rods, 𝜃, and the thickness
coefficient, 𝛽. The generation of the finite element meshes for this problem has been automated for the given parameters 𝜃and 𝛽,
where 20-noded hexahedral elements with reduced integration are used. The cross sections of the square loops and the inclined
rods are discretised regularly with 3 elements per side (𝑛el). Along their length, the number of elements is not fixed; rather, it
is determined by the expression ⌊𝑛el
(𝑙𝜇− 2𝑡) ∕𝑡⌋+ 2𝑛el. This setting has been identified as sufficient for the convergence of the
results. Thus, three examples are analysed: (i) the minimisation of the mass and maximisation of the infinitesimal stiffness, (ii) the
maximisation of the specific absorbed energy, and (iii) the minimisation of the mass and maximisation of the absorbed energy.
The first example is performed using infinitesimal strains, while the second and third examples are performed using a finite strain
formulation.
4.3.1. Minimisation of the mass and maximisation of the infinitesimal stiffness
The first example is a multi-objective optimisation problem that aims to minimise the mass and maximise the infinitesimal
stiffness of the CTC metamaterial. The Pareto front solution from the optimisation methods is compared with the analytical solution
derived in Appendix. The objective functions are defined as:
max
[𝜃 ,𝛽]∈
[𝐽1 (𝜃 , 𝛽) , 𝐽2 (𝜃 , 𝛽)
] = max
[𝜃 ,𝛽]∈
[−𝑚(𝜃 , 𝛽) , 𝑘𝑧(𝜃 , 𝛽)
] .
(41)
where the mass 𝑚is calculated analytically using Eq. (82), and the infinitesimal stiffness 𝑘𝑧is calculated numerically from
simulations. We start by prescribing a small compressive displacement of 𝛿𝑧= 𝜀𝐻at the top square loop, where 𝐻is the height of
the unit cell
𝐻= 𝑙𝜇[(1 −𝛽) t an (𝜃) + 2𝛽] ,
(42)
and 𝜀= 0.01%. Extracting the reaction force 𝐹, then the infinitesimal stiffness can be computed via the slope of the force–
displacement curve with
𝑘𝑧(𝜃 , 𝛽) = 𝐹𝑧(𝜃 , 𝛽)
𝛿𝑧(𝜃 , 𝛽) .
(43)
This prescription is specified using a single load increment in the numerical simulations, such that the output response is a two-point
curve with the points (0, 0) and (𝛿𝑧, 𝐹𝑧). The material properties of the inclined rods are presented in Table 4.
For compatibility with the composite Bayesian optimisation strategy, the objective function is defined as
[𝐽1 (𝜃 , 𝛽) , 𝐽2 (𝜃 , 𝛽)
] =
[
−𝑚(𝜃 , 𝛽) , 𝐹𝑧(𝜃 , 𝛽)
𝛿𝑧(𝜃 , 𝛽)
]

−𝑚(𝜃 , 𝛽) , Max ([𝜃 , 𝛽])

]

(46)
where is the outer composition function of the objective 𝐽2 (𝜃 , 𝛽) of the multi-objective problem. For this case, we compute the
vertical force 𝐹𝑧by extracting the maximum point of the force–displacement curve from the response functional [𝜃 , 𝛽]. With this
approach, both the mass 𝑚and the prescribed displacement 𝛿𝑧are computed directly from the analytical outer composition and do
not need to be learned by the surrogate model. The bounds of the input design variables, the angle 𝜃and the thickness coefficient 𝛽,
are
𝜃= [30, 80] ◦, 
𝛽= [0.05, 0.15],
(47)
respectively, and the initial values are set to the midpoints 𝜃= 55 ◦and 𝛽= 0.1.
To compare the methods, a total of 64 function evaluations are considered. For the Bayesian optimisation strategies, both the
classical and composite variants start with an initial dataset of 9 points (initial guess and 8 Sobol sequence points). In the Bessa
surrogate strategy, 64 points are randomly sampled from the design space with Sobol sequences. A schematic representation of the
design strategies for multi-objective optimisation is presented in Fig. 18. In this context, we introduce and compare three different
Pareto fronts:
• Sampled Pareto Front — corresponds to the Pareto front obtained by selecting the non-dominated points in the dataset
generated by each optimiser.
• Surrogate Pareto Front — using a surrogate model for the dataset generated by the optimisers, a multi-objective optimisation is
performed on this model to obtain an approximate Pareto front for the problem. This is particularly useful since the surrogate
model can be cheaply evaluated. Note, however, that these points are guesses from the surrogate model and may not correspond
to the true Pareto front.
• Sampled Surrogate Pareto Front — given the Surrogate Pareto front, we re-evaluate the points using the finite element model
to obtain a more accurate representation of the Pareto front and assess the quality of the surrogate model.
This approach enhances the fairness of comparison between methods. For instance, directly comparing Sampled Pareto fronts may
not be adequate between BO and Bessa surrogate strategies, as the latter has no knowledge of the problem during the sampling
stage. Additionally, comparisons with the Surrogate Pareto front may introduce the additional error of the surrogate model into the
analysis, since the evaluations are typically low-fidelity approximations of the actual problem. Finally, the Sampled Surrogate Pareto
front is expected to provide a more accurate representation of the Pareto front, as it is obtained by re-evaluating the points using
the finite element model. However, in practical applications, one typically compares the Sampled Pareto front of the BO strategies
with the Surrogate Pareto front of the Bessa surrogate strategy, as these represent the outputs of the optimisation methods.
The Surrogate Pareto front is computed using the well-known NSGA-II algorithm, as implemented in pymoo [74]. This genetic
algorithm is also used to determine the Pareto front for the analytical solution. For the genetic algorithm, 40 generations are
executed, starting with an initial population of 40 individuals and producing 20 offspring in subsequent generations. This setup
ensures convergence to the Pareto front with a total of 820 function evaluations. Both the Surrogate Pareto front and the Sampled
Surrogate Pareto front contain 40 points, one for each generation. Although a larger number of points could be selected due to the
low computational cost of the genetic algorithm, reevaluating the Surrogate Pareto front is computationally expensive as it requires
a finite element simulation for each point. It is important to note that the surrogate model is constructed solely to facilitate a fair
comparison of strategies and is not in the optimisation process.

Regarding evaluation metrics, the design strategies are assessed using hypervolume (HV), Generational Distance (GD) [75],
and the ratio between non-dominated and dominated solutions. The HV metric is a widely recognised performance indicator in
multi-objective optimisation, measuring the volume of the dominated space covered by the Pareto front. Higher HV values indicate
better-quality solutions. This metric does not require knowledge of the optimal Pareto front but does need a reference point, defined
as the worst possible point for each objective (see Fig. 8). In this example, the reference point for the hypervolume metric is set
to [𝑚max, 𝑘𝑧min]. Considering the previous bounds, the maximum mass is approximately 0.576 mg, and the minimum stiffness is 0
N mm−1. Therefore, the chosen reference point is [0.58, 0]. On the other hand, the GD metric requires a reference Pareto front for
calculation and evaluates the convergence of the obtained Pareto front to the true Pareto front. It calculates the Euclidean distance
from each point on the reference Pareto front (derived from the analytical solution) to the nearest point on the Pareto front produced
by the design strategy. Smaller GD values suggest a better approximation of the true Pareto front. However, it is important to note
that the analytical model is an approximation of the real structure and will inherently have some degree of error and, thus, this
metric should be interpreted with caution. Lastly, the ratio between non-dominated and dominated solutions is a straightforward
metric that assesses the effectiveness of the design strategy in identifying non-dominated solutions. A higher ratio should indicate
a more efficient sampling of the design strategy.
The median hypervolume convergence for the Sampled Pareto front is shown in Fig. 19. The Pareto fronts produced by both the
classical and composite Bayesian optimisation strategies are significantly superior to those generated by the Bessa surrogate strategy.
Additionally, both Bayesian strategies exhibit much less dispersion, with the classical Bayesian strategy achieving a slightly higher
hypervolume value in this instance. Furthermore, Fig. 20 illustrates the Pareto fronts for the various strategies, corresponding to the
evaluation where the hypervolume of the Sampled Pareto front is highest. All strategies successfully recovered the analytical solution
with the Sampled Surrogate Pareto front. However, it is noteworthy that the Bayesian strategies fully recovered the analytical
solution on the initial computation of the Pareto front (Sampled Pareto front). This presents a significant advantage, as the number
of function calls is considerably reduced since there is no need to construct and subsequently reevaluate a Surrogate Pareto front.
Table 5 presents the median hypervolume, generational distance, and the ratio of non-dominated to dominated solutions for all
Pareto fronts across the different strategies. The results show that for the Sampled Pareto front, both Bayesian strategies outperform
the Bessa surrogate strategy in terms of hypervolume and generational distance. They also have a higher ratio of non-dominated
to dominated solutions, demonstrating greater efficiency in identifying non-dominated solutions. For the Surrogate and Sampled
Surrogate Pareto fronts, the results are quite similar across all strategies. Due to the simplicity of the problem, the composite
Bayesian optimisation strategy does not particularly stand out in this example. However, as will be shown in the following examples,
the composite Bayesian optimisation strategy is expected to be more advantageous in more complex and nonlinear problems.

4.3.2. Maximisation of the ratio of the absorbed energy to the mass
This example focuses on the maximisation of the ratio of the absorbed energy to the mass of the CTC metamaterial, that is, the
specific absorbed energy, under finite strains. In addition to the geometry design, we also aim to select the material of the inclined
rods; particularly whether a fragile high-strength steel or a ductile low-strength steel should be used. For this task, data from several
steels were used to fit a curve of the elongation at break versus the tensile strength, as shown in Fig. 21, which is then used to predict
the maximum plastic strain of the material. For this case, the assumptions are:
• The unit cell is under a large deformation range, so the deformation caused by the axial force of the polygon loop cannot be
ignored, and the analytical solution is no longer valid.
• An elasto-plastic isotropic von Mises model with perfect plasticity is assumed. The mechanical properties of the material are
the same as in the previous case (see Table 4).
• The unit cell is subjected to uniaxial load. A compressive displacement of 𝛿𝑧= 𝜀𝑧𝐻is prescribed in the z-direction with 𝐻
being the height of the unit cell (Eq. (42)). In this case, because the unit cell undergoes large deformations, it is crucial to
validate all simulations to prevent excessive prescribed displacement that could cause penetration. To address this, a single-
objective optimisation with contact detection was conducted to determine the minimum strain the unit cell can endure without

penetration, given the bounds of the input design variables. The minimum strain identified was 𝜀𝑧= 9.29%, thus a 𝜀𝑧= 8%
was selected.
• The bottom square loop is constrained in all degrees of freedom and the top square loop is free to move and rotate.
• A straightforward failure criterion is used to predict material failure. The material is considered to have failed when a Gauss
point in the FEM mesh reaches the maximum accumulated plastic strain component. The maximum plastic strain is calculated
accordingly
𝜀𝑝
(𝜎𝑦
) = 𝑎
𝜎𝑦
+ 𝑏,
(48)
where the parameters 𝑎and 𝑏were calculated by fitting a curve of several data points of yield stress and the corresponding
elongation at failure for different steels, as can be seen in Fig. 21, and 𝜎𝑦is the yield stress from the design input variables.
Thus, the parameters are 𝑎= 77.4737 and 𝑏= −0.0171.
The input design variables are the angle 𝜃, the thickness coefficient 𝛽, as in the previous case, and the yield strength of the material
𝜎𝑦. The bounds for the design variables are defined as:
𝜃= [30, 80] ◦, 
𝛽= [0.05, 0.15], 
𝜎𝑦= [159, 1700] MPa.
(49)
The initial values are set to 𝜃= 55 ◦, 𝛽= 0.1 and 𝜎𝑦= 300 MPa. The objective function for this example is defined as:
max
[𝜃 ,𝛽 ,𝜎𝑦
]∈
𝐽(𝜃 , 𝛽 , 𝜎𝑦
) = 
max
[𝜃 ,𝛽 ,𝜎𝑦
]∈
𝐸abs
(𝜃 , 𝛽 , 𝜎𝑦
)
𝑚(𝜃 , 𝛽)
,
(50)
where the mass 𝑚is calculated analytically using Eq. (82) and the absorbed energy 𝐸abs is calculated numerically from simulations.
The absorbed energy is calculated by prescribing a compressive displacement of 𝛿𝑧at the top square loop and measuring the area
under the force–displacement curve by numerically integrating the response. The absorbed energy is then computed as
𝐸abs
(𝜃 , 𝛽 , 𝜎𝑦
) = ∫
𝛿𝑧max
0
𝐹𝑧
(𝜃 , 𝛽 , 𝜎𝑦
) d𝛿𝑧.
(51)
This prescription is specified using 50 load increments in the numerical simulations. For compatibility with the composite Bayesian
optimisation strategy, the objective function is defined as
𝐽(𝜃 , 𝛽 , 𝜎𝑦
) =
∫
𝛿𝑧max
0
𝐹𝑧
(𝜃 , 𝛽 , 𝜎𝑦

𝑚(𝜃 , 𝛽)

])
𝑚(𝜃 , 𝛽)
= (𝜃 , 𝛽 , 𝜎𝑦, [𝜃 , 𝛽 , 𝜎𝑦
]) ,
(52)
where is the outer composition function of the objective function of the single-objective problem using a trapezoidal integration
scheme for the response. This approach introduces the computation of the mass inside , and thus, it does not need to be learned
by the surrogate model.
To compare the strategies in this example, a total of 128 function evaluations are considered. For the Bayesian optimisation
strategies, default settings are used, with an initial dataset of 9 points (one initial guess and 8 Sobol points) for both the classical
and composite variants. The number of PCA points for the composite strategy varied between 6 and 12, depending on the complexity
of the numerical response. In the random sampling strategy, 130 points are randomly sampled from the design space. Additionally,
the Bessa surrogate strategy employs 128 function evaluations, using the same dataset as the random sampling strategy to build the
surrogate model.
The median objective evolution is depicted in Fig. 22. Both the classical and composite Bayesian optimisation strategies
outperform the random sampling and Bessa surrogate strategies. Furthermore, the composite Bayesian optimisation strategy is more
efficient than its classical counterpart. Notably, after approximately 50 function evaluations, the composite Bayesian optimisation

strategy consistently surpasses the classical Bayesian optimisation strategy. Table 6 presents the median best objective and parameter
values obtained by the different design strategies. The results indicate that the composite Bayesian optimisation strategy outperforms
the other strategies in terms of the objective function, demonstrating its effectiveness in solving this problem. The median best
objective value is 1.1533 J mg−1, which surpasses those obtained by the other strategies. The parameter values corresponding to this
best objective value are an angle of 74.6237◦, a thickness coefficient of 0.147, and a yield strength of 1699.9126 MPa. In addition, the
force–displacement response for the parameters and design strategies presented in Table 6 is shown in Fig. 23. The geometry of the
optimal solution (Composite BO) is also depicted with its respective accumulated plastic strain after deformation. The differences
between the responses clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of the Bayesian optimisation strategies, particularly the composite one.
4.3.3. Minimisation of the mass and maximisation of the absorbed energy
This third example is a multi-objective optimisation problem aimed at minimising the mass and maximising the absorbed energy
of the CTC metamaterial. The assumptions for this example are consistent with those in Section 4.3.2, under finite strains, rendering
the analytical solution inapplicable. Furthermore, the material itself is considered a design variable in this example. The objective
functions are defined as follows:
max
[𝜃 ,𝛽 ,𝜎𝑦
]∈
[𝐽1 (𝜃 , 𝛽) , 𝐽2
(𝜃 , 𝛽 , 𝜎𝑦
)] = 
max
[𝜃 ,𝛽 ,𝜎𝑦
]∈
[−𝑚(𝜃 , 𝛽) , 𝐸abs
(𝜃 , 𝛽 , 𝜎𝑦
)] .
(53)
where the mass 𝑚is calculated analytically using Eq. (82) and the absorbed energy 𝐸abs is calculated numerically from simulations,
accordingly with the previous example (Section 4.3.2). For compatibility with the composite Bayesian optimisation strategy, the
objective function is defined as
[𝐽1 (𝜃 , 𝛽) , 𝐽2
(𝜃 , 𝛽 , 𝜎𝑦
)] =
[
−𝑚(𝜃 , 𝛽) , ∫

])}
(55)
= {−𝑚(𝜃 , 𝛽) , (𝜃 , 𝛽 , 𝜎𝑦, [𝜃 , 𝛽 , 𝜎𝑦
])} ,
(56)
where is the outer composition function of the objective 𝐽2
(𝜃 , 𝛽 , 𝜎𝑦
) of the multi-objective problem using a Trapz function for the
response. As before, the mass is computed directly from the analytical solution and does not need to be learned by the surrogate
model. The bounds of the input design variables, the angle 𝜃, the thickness coefficient 𝛽and the yield stress 𝜎𝑦, are respectively
𝜃= [30, 80] ◦, 
𝛽= [0.05, 0.15], 
𝜎𝑦= [159, 1700] MPa.
(57)
The initial values are set to 𝜃= 55◦, 𝛽= 0.1 and 𝜎𝑦= 300 MPa. The reference point for the hypervolume metric in this scenario is
selected as [𝑚max, 𝐸absmin]. Taking into account the previous bounds, the maximum mass is approximately 0.576 mg and the minimum

energy is zero. Consequently, [0.58, 0] is chosen as a reference point. To compare the strategies in this example, a total of 128 function
evaluations are considered, and the Pareto front comparison strategy in Section 4.3.1 is adopted.
The median hypervolume convergence is displayed in Fig. 24. The Pareto fronts generated by both the classical and composite
Bayesian optimisation strategies are significantly better than those sampled by the Bessa Surrogate strategy. Furthermore, the
composite Bayesian strategy exhibits significantly less dispersion, particularly after approximately 60 function calls, where it
becomes almost negligible. It also achieves the highest hypervolume among all strategies, indicating superior performance. Naturally,
for all approaches, the hypervolume monotonically increases with the number of function calls. Fig. 25 illustrates the various
Pareto fronts for the different optimisation strategies. Particularly, this highlights the difference between the Sampled, Surrogate
and Sampled Surrogate Pareto fronts. This example also illustrates how the low-fidelity Surrogate Pareto front is generally over-
optimistic when compared to the Sampled Pareto front, which further motivates using high-fidelity evaluations (as those obtained
directly from BO strategies) to build the MO solution. Table 7 presents the median hypervolume and the ratio of non-dominated to
dominated solutions for all Pareto fronts across the different strategies. The results show that the composite Bayesian optimisation
strategy outperforms the others in terms of hypervolume for all Pareto fronts. Despite their lower hypervolume indicator, the classical
Bayesian strategy has a higher ratio of non-dominated to dominated solutions in the Sampled Pareto front, while the Bessa Surrogate
strategy shows a higher ratio in the Surrogate Sampled Pareto front. Finally, in Fig. 26, the optimal Sampled Pareto front for the three
design strategies is displayed. Additionally, the geometries of three distinct solutions for the Composite BO strategy are illustrated,
emphasising the significant variations among the potential optimal design solutions found on the Pareto front.

4.4. Layered metallic foam beam under bending
In this example, the optimisation of the cross-sectional material of a beam under bending is considered. The beam is composed
of 16 layers of metallic foam, with each layer having a different relative foam density and, hence, different mechanical properties.
In this case, the geometry consists of a beam with a length of 4 m and a height of 1 m under plane strain conditions. The leftmost end
of the beam is fixed, and a moment 𝑀is applied at the rightmost end. A regular mesh with 32 × 16 quadratic 8-node quadrilateral
elements is used to discretise the beam; thus we consider a row of elements for each layer of the beam. A schematic representation
of the beam is shown in Fig. 27.
In this example, a simplistic approach has been adopted to model the behaviour of the metallic foam. Considering the review
from Smith et al. [76], we adopt a foam obtained from a powder metallurgical process, with a relative density ranging from 0.04 to
0.65. Then, according to the Gibson and Ashby model [77], the elastic modulus and the yield stress of the foam can be estimated
from a set of empirical equations relying on specific parameters. In this work, we consider the following equations to estimate the
elastic modulus and the yield stress of the foam:
𝐸= 𝐸𝑠
(0.5𝜉2 + 0.3𝜉) ,
(58)
𝜎𝑦,𝑐= 0.5𝜎𝑦,𝑠
(0.5𝜉2∕3 + 0.3𝜉) ,
(59)
𝜎𝑦,𝑡= 1.2𝜎𝑦,𝑐,
(60)
where 𝐸𝑠and 𝜎𝑦,𝑠are the elastic modulus and the yield stress of the solid material, 𝜎𝑦,𝑡and 𝜎𝑦,𝑐denote the tensile and compressive
yield stress of the foam and 𝜉is the relative foam density,
𝜉= 𝜌
𝜌𝑠
.
(61)
For the properties of the solid material, 𝐸𝑠= 210 GPa, 𝜈= 0.33 and 𝜎𝑦,𝑠= 200 MPa have been selected. Since different tensile and
compressive yield stresses are considered, a Drucker–Prager plasticity model is adopted to model the foam behaviour, whose yield
criterion is given by,
𝜏+ 𝑝t an 𝜙= 𝑐 ,
(62)
where 𝜏is the shear stress, 𝑝is the hydrostatic pressure, 𝜙is the internal friction angle and 𝑐is the cohesion. According to Eq. (60),
and considering a scalar 𝛼= 𝜎𝑦,𝑡∕𝜎𝑦,𝑐= 1.2, it can be shown that the internal friction angle is constant and given by
t an 𝜙= −3
2
𝛼− 1
𝛼+ 1 ⇒𝜙= −7.765◦,
(63)
and the cohesion is given by
𝑐= 𝜎𝑦,𝑐
(
1 + 𝛼− 1
𝛼+ 1
)
.
(64)
Finally, for simplicity, the associative Drucker–Prager variant is used, and perfect plasticity is assumed. Therefore, the foam
constitutive response is modelled as an elastic–plastic material whose elastic and plastic properties depend on the relative
foam density. Note that more sophisticated models can be adopted to model the foam behaviour, such as the ones in Miller

[78], Deshpande and Fleck [79], Reyes et al. [80], but for the sake of simplicity, the Gibson and Ashby model is adopted in this
example.
The optimisation procedure focuses on finding the optimal distribution of the relative foam density of each layer according to
a given objective, which is defined on a per-example basis. Thus, we define the 16-dimensional design space for the relative foam
density, 𝜉𝑖, using the theoretical bounds expected for this foam type,
𝜉𝑖∈ [0.04, 0.65], 
𝑖= 1, … , 16.

For this problem setup, two examples are analysed: (i) the maximisation of the infinitesimal specific beam bending stiffness, and
(ii) the maximisation of the specific absorbed energy for a prescribed rotation of 5◦at the rightmost edge.
4.4.1. Maximisation of the infinitesimal specific beam bending stiffness
The first example aims to maximise the infinitesimal specific beam bending stiffness, defined as the ratio between the infinitesimal

This prescription is specified using a single load increment in the finite element analysis, so the output response of the program is

(69)
where is the outer composition of the objective function and we find the maximum value of the moment–angle response to
compute the stiffness. This approach introduces the computation of the density directly inside and, therefore, it does not need to
be learned by the surrogate model. Note that the numerical response for this case is a two-point curve of the elastic response of the
beam under bending.
To compare the strategies in this example, a total of 128 function evaluations are considered. For the Bayesian optimisation
strategies, the default settings are used, with an initial dataset of 33 points (initial guess and 32 Sobol points) for both the classical
and composite variants. In the random sampling strategy, 128 points are randomly sampled from the design space. Finally, the Bessa
surrogate strategy is used with 128 function evaluations, where the surrogate model is built using the same dataset as the random
sampling strategy.
The median objective evolution is depicted in Fig. 28. Both the classical and composite Bayesian optimisation strategies
drastically outperform both the random sampling and the Bessa surrogate strategies. In addition, the composite Bayesian optimisation
strategy is slightly more efficient than the classical Bayesian optimisation strategy — it showcases a higher median value.
Particularly, after 128 function evaluations, the dispersion in the objective value is almost insignificant for the composite Bayesian
optimisation strategy, while the classical Bayesian optimisation strategy still presents a considerable dispersion. Furthermore, the
cross-section associated with the median best-observed objective value for each optimiser is shown in Fig. 29. Both the classical
and composite Bayesian optimisation strategies find a similar cross-section, with a higher density in the outer layers and a lower
density in the inner layers — a result that is consistent with the expected stresses in the cross-section under bending. On the other
hand, both the random sampling and the Bessa surrogate strategies find a cross-section with more randomly distributed densities
and, particularly, with increased asymmetry.
4.4.2. Maximisation of the specific absorbed energy
In the second example, we aim to optimise a quantity computed from the response of the beam under finite strains bending with
plastic activity. Therefore, the objective function is defined as the maximisation of the specific absorbed energy, which is computed
as the ratio between the absorbed energy 𝐸abs and the density of the beam,

rotation 𝜙max = 5◦, that is,
𝐸abs (𝝃) = ∫

𝑀(𝝃, 𝜙) d𝜙.
(71)
The moment–rotation response is computed with the finite element solver, using 50 load increments up to the prescribed rotation.
Then, the integration is carried out numerically using a trapezoidal rule. As in the previous example, we can exploit the composition
to embed the density computation inside the objective function,

where is the outer composition of the objective function and Trapz denotes the trapezoidal integration rule to compute the
absorbed energy. In contrast with the previous case, the numerical response is an elasto-plastic curve with 50 points. For comparison
purposes, all optimisers are evaluated with a budget of 256 function calls, using 20 realisations.
The median objective evolution and its 95 % confidence interval are depicted in Fig. 30. Similarly to the previous case, the classical
and composite Bayesian optimisation strategies drastically outperform the random sampling and the Bessa surrogate strategies.
Furthermore, the composite Bayesian optimisation converges faster than the classical Bayesian optimisation and shows a significantly
smaller dispersion in the objective value. These results further confirm the efficiency of the composite Bayesian optimisation strategy
in this example. In addition, the cross-section associated with the median best-observed objective value for each optimiser is shown
in Fig. 31. Both BO strategies show similar cross-sections, with a higher density in the outer layers and a lower density in the
inner layers, as well as a given asymmetry associated with the pressure-sensitive behaviour of the foam. On the other hand, Bessa’s
strategy effectively finds a cross-section where the density is localised in the outer layers, but fails to refine it further to achieve
a higher objective value. Finally, the random sampling strategy finds a cross-section with a more random distribution of densities,
which performs poorly for this example.
5. Conclusions
In the present contribution, a novel framework for material and structural design based on a tailored composite Bayesian
Optimisation strategy is proposed. Unlike traditional optimisation methods, this composite variant leverages the inherent structure
of the objective function. This approach enables the optimiser to (i) observe the complete response of the numerical simulation,

(ii) enhance the predictive accuracy of the surrogate model, and (iii) seamlessly integrate the objective function’s structure into the
optimisation framework.
The formulation of the composite problem incorporates numerous elements essential for optimising generic responses, which
we analyse in detail. Key aspects include the reparameterisation of the response into a latent response space, the selection of the
surrogate model, and the use of gradient-enabled Monte Carlo acquisition functions. Additionally, we explore the application of
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. While optional, PCA not only reduces the computational burden
of the optimisation but also improves the efficiency due to its weakly correlated feature set.
The composite Bayesian optimisation strategy involves defining two hyperparameters: the number of initial Design of Exper-
iments (DoE) points and the PCA variance threshold. The former is particularly vital for balancing the exploration-exploitation
tradeoff in Bayesian optimisation strategies. We address the selection of these values through a parametric study, providing heuristics
for their definition. Our findings indicate that the number of initial DoE points should increase with the number of dimensions but
must be balanced to avoid slowing down optimisation convergence. Conversely, a small, constant PCA variance threshold is sufficient
to achieve a favourable tradeoff between computational time and accuracy. While optimal hyperparameters are problem-specific,
our recommendations perform well across the problems analysed in this work.
The efficacy of the proposed design framework is evaluated across various linear and nonlinear material and structural design
problems, encompassing single-objective and multi-objective scenarios, both with and without observation noise. We compare
our approach against three baseline optimisation strategies. Our analyses demonstrate that the composite strategy achieves faster
convergence, reduced variability between runs, and superior optima compared to other methods. These benefits are particularly
pronounced with increasing objective function complexity, such as in cases involving geometric or material non-linearity. The
enhanced sampling efficiency of our method reduces the number of required experiments to achieve a specified objective value.
Overall, the results exhibit significant improvements in performance and quality, especially in nonlinear settings, underscoring
the potential of our framework to advance design methodologies in material and structural engineering.

Appendix. Infinitesimal strain solution for the compression–torsion coupled metamaterial
To validate the numerical example in Section 4.3.1, an analytical model has been derived to predict the response of the unit
cell under infinitesimal strains and isotropic linear elastic material behaviour. The analytical solution was primarily built upon the
work established by [81,82]. However, some modifications have been introduced to accommodate slight differences in the unit
cell geometry and to improve the quality of the solution, since the previous works had some limitations. The developed analytical
solution shows a close agreement with numerical results and is based on the Euler–Bernoulli beam theory. In this model, the inclined
rods are represented as beams with rectangular cross-sections, while the top and bottom square loops are treated as rigid bodies13
with quadrangular cross-sections.
For this model, a Z-shaped structure is considered as the unit cell, as shown in Fig. 32. The two critical lengths 𝑙1 and 𝑙2 are
introduced to define the geometry of the unit cell, which are closely related to the length of the inclined rods and the square loops.
With this approach, note that the angle of the inclined rods is defined as 𝛼instead of 𝜃, such that the length of the square loop is
𝑙𝜇−𝑡which guarantees a height (distance between the top and bottom square loops) equal to the distance of the two neutral lines
of the bottom and top square loops cross-section. According to these assumptions, the necessary equations to define the geometry
of the unit cell are given by
𝛼= ar ct an

)
,
(73)
𝑙2 = 𝑙𝜇−𝑡= 𝑙𝜇(1 −𝛽) ,
(74)
𝑙1 =

cos (𝛼) .
(75)
The degrees of freedom for this model are defined as 𝛿𝑧, 𝛿𝑐and 𝜑𝑧, which represent the relative displacement along the z-
direction, the increment of the circumference (expansion) of the top square loop and the twisting angle of the unit cell that is
defined as the rotation angle in the x–y plane after deformation, respectively. The degrees of freedom are represented in Fig. 33.
Thus, the compression–torsion coupling constitutive relation of the unit cell can be defined as
